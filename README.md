# KNN-search-in-C

This is a mini project developed for the ECCE Auth course - Parallel and Distrubuted Systems.

It include various implementations of the famous KNN Search algorithm:

1. Serial (Single Process-Single Thread)

2. Parallel (Single Process-Multiple Threads)

3. Serial Distributed (Multiple Process- Single Thread/Process), Blocking Comms

4. Serial Distributed (Multiple Process- Single Thread/Process), Non-Blocking Comms

5. Parallel Distributed (Multiple Process- Multiple Thread/Process), Blocking Comms

6. Parallel Distributed (Multiple Process- Multiple Thread/Process), Non-Blocking Comms


The parallelization was made using OpenMP and the distribution using MPI
